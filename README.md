# FakeJobPosting

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning solution to automatically detect fake job postings from online job boards. We will collect a dataset containing both genuine and fake job postings and preprocess it for training. Three popular ML algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree - will be trained on the data to learn patterns distinguishing genuine from fake postings. We will then evaluate and compare the performance of these models using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective approach. By identifying the best-performing algorithm, we aim to contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient online job boards, ultimately benefiting both job seekers and employers.
